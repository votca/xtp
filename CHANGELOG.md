## Version 1.4_rc1 (released 26.09.16)

* include manual
* an extension of the whole workflow from: electrons and holes, to singlet and triplet excitons
* a fully functional GW-BSE code optimized for: molecular properties, including excited state geometry optimizsation
* Inclusion of LIBXC to calculate Exchange correlation matrices
* allowing interfacing GW-BSE with many quantum mechanical packages
* support for ORCA DFT package
* framework to use stochastic models to generate larger system
* better performance of larger systems
* new calculators: egwbse,igwbse,ewald,.....

* integration of moo and kmc into xtp for easier installation
* kmc_lifetime calculator to simulate exciton movement with lifetimes
* partialcharges to extract atomic charges from qm calculation
* renaming from ctp to xtp
* many bugfixes

## Version 1.3 (released XX.09.15)

* new executables: ctp_tools, ctp_dump, ctp_parallel, xtp_testsuite, xtp_update
* ctp_tools wraps light-weight tools that assist e.g. in generating the system mapping file
* ctp_dump extracts information from the state file to human-readable format
* ctp_parallel wraps heavy-duty job-based calculators: allows synchronization across processes
* ctp_testsuite provides an easy-to-use environment to run: selected tests, individual calculators
* ctp_update updates an existent state file to the current version
* new calculators: edft, idft, pdb2map, xqmultipole, ...
* edft / idft: provide interfaces to the GAUSSIAN, TURBOMOLE & NWCHEM package, using packages computes: couplings, internal energies, partial charges
* pdb2map (generates a system mapping file from an input coordinate file)
* xqmultipole computes classical configuration energies of: charged clusters embedded in a molecular environment
* enhanced usability via the command-line help, tutorial & test-suite
* a GUI tutorial assists with the first practical steps in using VOTCA-CTP
* an extended and homogenized help system provides: short infos on individual calculator options from the command line

## Version 1.0 (released 23.10.11)

* parallel evaluation of site energies using: Thole model + GDMA - Tinker no longer required
* much clearer input files (and many more checks for input errors)
* most of calculators are parallel and can be used on a cluster
* bug in zindo/ctp interface fixed
* state file now contains: the atomistic trajectory, rigid fragments, conjugated segments
* support for several MD frames
