.SH NAME

.P
votca\-csg \- The VOTCA coarse\-graining engine

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Versatile Object\-oriented Toolkit for Coarse\-graining Applications (VOTCA) is a package intended to reduce the amount of routine work when doing systematic coarse\-graining of various systems.
The core is written in C++. Iterative methods are implemented using bash + perl.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
The following commands make up the votca\-csg suite.  Please refer to their individual man pages for further details.

.TP
\fBcsg_boltzmann\fR
Performs tasks that are needed for simple Boltzmann inversion in an interactive environment.
.TP
\fBcsg_call\fR
Calls script from the interactive framework for the user.
.TP
\fBcsg_density\fR
Calculates all kind of density profiles.
.TP
\fBcsg_dlptopol\fR
Create skeleton for dlpoly topology based on atomistic topology and a mapping file.
.TP
\fBcsg_dump\fR
Prints atoms that are read from a topology file to help debug atom naming.
.TP
\fBcsg_fmatch\fR
Performs force matching (also called \fImultiscale coarse\-graining\fR).
